# Asymptotic Notations

Asymptotic Notations are mathematical notations to represent Order of Growth (or Time Complexity) of any mathematical function.

## Most/Popularly used Asymptotic Notations

#### Big O - $O(n)$
- Exact or Upper Bound
- Bounds a function only from above

#### Theta - $\theta(n)$
- Exact Bound
- Bounds a function from above and below

#### Omega - $\Omega(n)$
- Exact or Lower Bound
- Bounds a function only from below

## Example
- In simple known equation like $C_1n^2 + C_2n + C3$, exact order of growth - $\theta(n^2)$
- Use of Big O or Omega is if algorithm takes different time in certain cases.

#### Linear Search
```
int search (int arr[], int n, int x) <br>
  for (int i=0; i<n; i++) <br>
      if (arr[i] == x) <br>
          return i; <br>
  return -1;
```

- In Best case ($x$ present at arr[0]) it takes constant time
- In Worst case ($x$ not present) it takes linear time

### Big O Notation
- This takes $O(n)$ time
- Either linear or less than linear
- $O(n)$ = $O(n^2)$ = $O(n^3)$
- Because it tells Upper Bound, so $O(n^2)$ covers $O(n)$ also

### Theta Notation
- This doen't not take exact time, so we can say
- This takes $\theta(n)$ time in worst case
- This takes $\theta(1)$ time in best case

### Omega Notation
- This takes $\Omega(1)$ time
- Either constant, or higher than constant
- $\Omega(1)$ = $\Omega(n)$
- Because it tells Lower Bound, so $\Omega(1)$ covers $\Omega(n)$ also
