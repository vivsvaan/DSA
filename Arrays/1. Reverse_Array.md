# Reverse an Array

Swap Array elements

- Use 2 pointers (low = 0, high = N-1)
- Swap arr[low] and arr[high]
- increment low, decrement high

```
void reverse(int arr[], int n)
  int low = 0, high = n-1
  while (low < high)
    int temp = arr[low]
    arr[low] = arr[high]
    arr[high] = temp
    low++;
    high--;
```
