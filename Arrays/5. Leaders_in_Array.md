# Find Leaders in Array

Leader in Array is an element which is largest than all elements towards right side.

- Last element is always a leader, print it
- Set currentLeader to last element $(currL = arr[n-1])$
- Start from second last element $(i=n-2)$
- If we find any element greater than $currL$, print it, update $currL$

```
void leader(int arr[], int n)
  int curr_l = arr[n-1]
  print(curr_l)
  for (i=n-2; i>=0; i--;)
    if (arr[i] > curr_l)
      curr_l = arr[i]
      print(curr_l)
```
