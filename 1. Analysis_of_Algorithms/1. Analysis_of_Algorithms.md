# Analysis of Algorithms
- Algorithm analysis is an important part of computational complexity theory.
- It provides theoretical estimation for the required resources of an algorithm to solve a specific computational problem.
- It is the determination of the amount of time and space resources required to execute that algorithm.

## Why Analysis of Algorithms is Important
- To predict the behavior of an algorithm without implementing it on a specific computer.
- It is much more convenient to have simple measures for the efficiency of an algorithm than to implement the algorithm and test the efficiency every time a certain parameter in the underlying computer system changes.
- It is impossible to predict the exact behaviour of an algorithm. There are too many influencing factors.
- The analysis is thus only an approximation; it is not perfect.
- More importantly, by analyzing different algorithms, we can compare them to determine the best one for our purpose.
