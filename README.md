# DSA - Data Structures and Algorithms
_Quick revision guide for Data Structures and Algorithms_

## Data Structure
Way to Organize data in Main Memory or RAM

## Algorithm
The sequence of steps that we write to solve a problem

## Importance of DSA in Problem Solving
- Problem Solving requires Processing the Data.
- Processing the Data requires storing the Data in Memory.
- DS teaches us how data can be stored efficiently in memory so that it can be processed faster.
- Algorithm teaches us writing the most efficient sequence of steps to solve a problem.
- It saves a log of CPU cycles.
- Makes our Software better.
