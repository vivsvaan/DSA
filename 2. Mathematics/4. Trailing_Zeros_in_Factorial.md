# Trailing Zeros in Factorial

### Basic Idea

- Write number's prime factorisation.
- 2's and 5's make 0, and 5's will be less, so count 5's.
- N will have minimum $\frac{n}{5}$ 5's
- There will be numbers which have more than one 5 like 25.
- We need to count those also.

$$Trailing Zero Count = \lfloor\frac{n}{5}\rfloor + \lfloor\frac{n}{25}\rfloor + \lfloor\frac{n}{125}\rfloor + ...$$

```
int countTrailingZeros(int n)
  int res = 0;
  for (int i = 5; i<=n; i = i*5)
    res = res + n/i;

  return res;
```
